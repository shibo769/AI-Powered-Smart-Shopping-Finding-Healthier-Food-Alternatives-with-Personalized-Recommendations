{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","#### Introduction\n","This section focuses on generating random shopping lists based on an existing food product dataset (food_fact). By leveraging available product codes, the function creates a controlled set of simulated shopping lists, each containing a random selection of items from the dataset. This process ensures that the generated lists are valid and represent realistic scenarios for further testing and analysis of recommendation algorithms.\n","\n","The goal is to provide a standardized and repeatable method to produce diverse shopping lists that can be used to evaluate recommendation methods, such as algorithm-based (Step 7) and GPT-based systems. These generated lists maintain flexibility in their structure, containing varying numbers of items (ranging from 3 to 50), which mimic the variability in real-world shopping behaviors.\n","\n","By integrating randomness, data validation, and reproducibility, this process lays the foundation for robust experimentation and comparison across different recommendation systems, ensuring consistency while supporting meaningful insights into their effectiveness.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"w6SXDT7iU8rW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"818613da-01a4-4cdf-e11d-e5372dce748b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732413384484,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":16375,"user":{"displayName":"Shilong Li","userId":"05976030556686191781"}},"id":"ELw59tYYyK04"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"1wIIlyCSnH5h","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732413387150,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":2668,"user":{"displayName":"Shilong Li","userId":"05976030556686191781"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"726cef81-83ed-412c-f969-34e15a9d3106"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Random shopping lists saved to: drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/random_shopping_lists.csv\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-4-68574d1b0b01>:6: DtypeWarning: Columns (1) have mixed types.
